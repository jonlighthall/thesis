\chapter{Two Example Measurements}
\label{standards}
A successful measurement of a reaction in inverse kinematics requires a high-efficiency, high-resolution detector system with large acceptance and good background suppression.  The traditional solution to these issues is to use a large detector array with fine angular resolution~\cite{Pollacco_2005,Catford_2005,Demonchy_2007,Kanungo_2010}.  This chapter discusses two benchmark reaction measurements in inverse kinematics using the traditional---or non-solenoidal---detector approach wherein the laboratory energy $E_\mathrm{lab}$ of the detected particles is measured as a function of the laboratory angle $\theta_\mathrm{lab}$ to determine the center-of-mass quantities.

\subsection{Introduction}
\label{b12intro}
A measurement of the $^{12}$B($d$,$p$) reaction was carried out at Argonne National Laboratory to study the neutron-rich $N=8$ nucleus $^{13}$B.  The details of this measurement are described in Ref.~\cite{Lee_2010}; this section summarizes those results.  Originally, the main purpose of this experiment was a nuclear structure study.  There is a pair of excited states in $^{13}$B near 3.6\,MeV, separated by 199\,keV, which had (at the time of the experiment) unknown spins. % and parities.
  The aim of this measurement was to resolve this doublet and through the analysis of the resulting angular distributions, determine the angular momentum transfer $\ell_n$ and assign spins and parities $J^\pi$ to the states.

\subsection{Experimental Setup}
%\section{Ludwig's Castle}
The experiment was carried out in the scattering chamber upstream from the Enge Split-Pole Spectrograph in ATLAS Target Area III (SPSIII), referred to internally as Ludwig's Castle.  
\subsubsection{Beam Production}
\label{beamprod}
$^{12}$B is unstable against $\beta$-decay with a half-life of $T_{1/2}=20.2$\,ms.  Therefore, a reaction involving $^{12}$B must be performed in inverse kinematics.  In this example, the $^{12}$B beam is produced in-flight, following the method %of beam production used in this experiment
which is described in detail in Ref.~\cite{Harss_2000}.  A primary beam of stable $^{11}$B ions at an energy of 81\,MeV and an intensity of 100\,pnA bombarded a cryogenic gas cell to produce the secondary radioactive beam. % via the $d$($^{12}$B,$p$) reaction.
The production cell is shown in Fig.~\ref{gas_cell}.  The gas cell was filled with D$_2$ deuterium gas at a pressure of 1400\,mbar and temperature of $-185$\,$^\circ$C to produce a target with an areal density of 1.6\,mg/cm$^2$.  The secondary $^{12}$B beam was produced in the neutron transfer reaction $d$($^{11}$B,$^{12}$B)$p$.  The resulting radioactive beam bombarded an 150\,$\mu$g/cm$^2$ target of deuterated polyethylene (C$_2$D$_4$)$_n$ with an average beam intensity of $1.2\times 10^5$\,ions/s.

\subsubsection{Detectors}
The  detector setup for measuring transfer reactions within Ludwig's Castle is described in Ref.~\cite{Wuosmaa_2005}.  The same basic setup was used in this measurement.  The detector array utilized in this experiment consists of three 500\,$\mu$m thick double-sided silicon strip detectors (DSSD) of design S1 manufactured by Micron Semiconductor.  The annular detectors have an inner radius of 24\,mm and an outer radius of 48\,mm, for a total active area of 53\,cm$^2$.  One side of each detector is segmented into 16 concentric rings of $\Delta r=1.5$\,mm, while the other side is segmented into 16 wedges, each covering $\Delta \phi =22.5^\circ$; thus each detector requires 32 electronics channels.  To suppress spurious counts, a detector signal is required in an element on both sides of a given detector in order to be included in the trigger logic.  Heavy recoils are identified downstream from the target in a $\Delta E$-$E$ detector array discussed in Chapt.~\ref{recoil}.  In an adjacent scattering chamber downstream from the heavy recoil detectors, a surface barrier detector is placed in the beam path behind an % 100$\times$
 attenuator to monitor the beam current.

Fig.~\ref{annular_dets} shows the physical relationship of the detectors to the target foil within the scattering chamber.  The  $^{12}$B($d$,$p$) reaction has a $K_\mathrm{g.s.}$-value of 0.61, which means forward angles in the center-of-mass correspond to rearward angles in the laboratory ($\theta_\mathrm{lab}>90^\circ$); hence the detector array is position upstream from the target foil.  Table~\ref{coverage} shows the solid-angle coverage for the detector array.  The entire array covered a solid angle of 1.10\,sr.

As shown in Table~\ref{error_prop}, the expected energy resolution of the $^{12}$B($d$,$p$) reaction is on the order of 120\,keV.  This estimate neglects beam spot size ($\approx 3$\,mm ) and target thickness (150\,$\mu$g/cm$^2$) effects. The beam spot size will have the same effect on any measurement.  The target thickness, however, has a pronounced effect on the $Q$-value resolution in inverse kinematics because the heavy ion experiences significant energy loss entering and exiting the target. %The beam spot size was 
Therefore, the reported $Q$-value resolution of 250\,keV is not surprising.  However, this resolution was insufficient to resolve the states at $E_x=3.482$ and 3.681\,MeV ($\Delta E_x=199$\,keV).  Therefore the separate angular distributions of these states could not be analyzed, making a determination of the angular momentum transfer impossible.  Fig.~\ref{b11b12_spec} shows the excitation energy spectra for both reactions.  The measurement of this reaction was re\-at\-tempt\-ed in order to separate these states using the HELIOS spectrometer as discussed in Chapt.~\ref{rib_com}.

Although %the $Q$-value resolution of this measurement was insufficient to separate the doublet near 3.6\,MeV, 
the original aim of this experiment was not realized,
the experiment did provide a new measurement that had astrophysical implications.  Eq.~\ref{eq:a12rproc} shows the $r$-process path through the light elements.  Included in the reaction chain is neutron capture on $^{11}$B (indicated by the underbrace).  The $^{11}$B($d$,$p$)$^{12}B$ neutron-transfer reaction is an example of a measurement that can be used to study the $r$-process.  Recoil tagging, using particle identification in the $\Delta E$-$E$ array (discussed in Chapt.~\ref{recoil}), was used to measure the branching ratio of $^{12}$B decay.  The neutron-unbound 3.389\,MeV state in $^{12}$B is predominately populated in coincidence with the recoiling $^{12}$B nucleus, corresponding to $\gamma$-decay of $^{12}$B$^\textrm{*}$.  However, a fraction of the events populating the 3.389\,MeV state were measured in coincidence with a $^{11}$B, corresponding to in-flight $n$-decay.   The ratio of the yield of these events is related to resonant neutron capture in $^{11}$B which contributes to both the overall rate of the $r$-process~\cite{Surman_2009}.  The details of this relationship are discussed in Ref.~\cite{Lee_2010}.
